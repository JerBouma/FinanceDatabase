The Sub-fund is not expected to invest more than 25% in the shares of smaller companies, which are widely viewed as being riskier than shares in larger companies. Investing in shares of smaller companies enables the Sub-fund to find dividend income in a broader set of companies and, in the opinion of the fund managers, differentiates the Sub-fund from other similar funds.",
