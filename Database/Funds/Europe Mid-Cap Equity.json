In view of the generally higher price sensitivity of shares for small- to medium-sized companies (small- and mid caps) as compared with shares of large companies (large caps), risk management is of considerable importance. In this regard, substantial quantities of liquid assets (cash) and/or government bonds may be maintained from time to time, but the capital of the Fund will, in principle, be invested in shares. In addition, the emphasis lies on shares that are issued by European companies that are traded on recognized stock exchanges.",
