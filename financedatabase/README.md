| **Call for Contributors to the FinanceDatabase** |
|:------------------------------------------------------:|
| The **FinanceDatabase** serves the role of providing anyone with any type of financial product categorisation entirely for free. To be able to achieve this, the FinanceDatabase relies on involvement from the community to update, edit and remove tickers over time. This is made easy enough that anyone, even with a lack of coding experience can contribute because of the usage of CSV files that can be manually edited.
**I'd like to invite you to go to the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to understand how you can help. Thank you!** |

As a private investor, the sheer amount of information that can be found on the internet is rather daunting. Trying to understand what type of companies or ETFs are available is incredibly challenging with there being millions ofcompanies and derivatives available on the market. Sure, the most traded companies and ETFs can quickly be foundsimply because they are known to the public (for example, Microsoft, Tesla, S&P500 ETF or an All-World ETF). However, what else is out there is often unknown.

**This database tries to solve that**. It features 300.000+ symbols containing Equities, ETFs, Funds, Indices, Currencies, Cryptocurrencies and Money Markets. It therefore allows you to obtain a broad overview of sectors, industries, types of investments and much more.

The aim of this database is explicitly _not_ to provide up-to-date fundamentals or stock data as those can be obtained with ease (with the help of this database) by using [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) or [FundamentalAnalysis](https://github.com/JerBouma/FundamentalAnalysis). Instead, it gives insights into the products that exist in each country, industry and sector and gives the most essential information about each product. With this information, you can analyse specific areas of the financial world and/or find a product that is hard to find. 

# Installation
The package `financedatabase` allows you to select specific json files as well as search through collected data with a specific query.

You can install the package with the following steps:
1. `pip install financedatabase -U`
2. (within Python) `import financedatabase as fd`

Please see the Jupyter Notebook for an elaborate explanation of each asset class. This includes Equities, ETFs, Funds, Indices, Currencies, Cryptocurrencies and Money Markets.
