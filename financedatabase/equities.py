        ----
        Returns all equities when no input is given and has the option to give
        a specific set of symbols for the country, sector and/or industry provided.

        The data depends on the combination of inputs. For example Country + Sector
        gives all symbols for a specific sector in a specific country.

        Input
        ----
        country (string, default is None)
            If filled, gives all data for a specific country.
        sector (string, default is None)
            If filled, gives all data for a specific sector.
        industry (string, default is None)
            If filled, gives all data for a specific industry.
        exclude_exchanges (boolean, default is True):
            Whether you want to exclude exchanges from the search. If False,
            you will receive multiple times the product from different exchanges.
        capitalize (boolean, default is True):
            Whether country, sector and industry needs to be capitalized. By default
            the values always are capitalized as that is also how it is represented
            in the csv files.
        base_url (string, default is GitHub location)
            The possibility to enter your own location if desired.
        use_local_location (string, default False)
            The possibility to select a local location (i.e. based on Windows path)
