        Description
        ----
        Returns all indices when no input is given and has the option to give
        a specific combination of indices based on the currency defined.

        Input
        ----
        currency (string, default is None)
            If filled, gives all data for a specific currency.
        capitalize (boolean, default is True):
            Whether the currency needs to be capitalized. By default the values
            always are capitalized as that is also how it is represented in the csv files.
        exclude_exchanges (boolean, default is True):
            Whether you want to exclude exchanges from the search. If False,
            you will receive multiple times the product from different exchanges.
        base_url (string, default is GitHub location)
            The possibility to enter your own location if desired.
        use_local_location (string, default False)
            The possibility to select a local location (i.e. based on Windows path)
