        Returns all funds when no input is given and has the option to give
        a specific set of symbols for the category and/or family provided.

        The data depends on the combination of inputs. For example Category + Family
        gives all symbols for a specific category for a specific family.

        Input
        ----
        category (string, default is None)
            If filled, gives all data for a specific category.
        family (string, default is None)
            If filled, gives all data for a specific family.
        exclude_exchanges (boolean, default is True):
            Whether you want to exclude exchanges from the search. If False,
            you will receive multiple times the product from different exchanges.
        capitalize (boolean, default is True):
            Whether country, sector and industry needs to be capitalized. By default
            the values always are capitalized as that is also how it is represented
            in the csv files.
        base_url (string, default is GitHub location)
            The possibility to enter your own location if desired.
